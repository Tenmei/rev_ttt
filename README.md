Reverse Tic-Tac-Toe game

This is a 5 x 5 tic-tac-toe with a twist: the first player to get 3 in a row loses(!).
Here 'X' starts first. Further, to offset the disadvantage of the first player, if he
gets 3-in-a-row, the second player is forced to make one more final move. If he too
gets 3-in-a-row, the game ends in a draw.
